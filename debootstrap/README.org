* video forwarding
KVM and it's derivatives have a VNC server in its video subsystem. So you have to take a VNC client (any from widely availables), configure your KVM VM machine with a VNC connection (I usually do this by supplying a =--graphics vnc,port=5900,listen=0.0.0.0= option to the virt-install program) and use it to remotely install any operating system you want.
